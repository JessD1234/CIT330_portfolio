        <h1>Notes:</h1>
        <p>Note to reader: I really just thought vommit here, so please excuse the lack of organization. </p>
        <p>Here are my notes for this week:</p>
        <p>Copying the repository instructions here since I will probably use these again at some point:</p>

            <p>If you aren't sure how to get a version control repository setup, here is a cheatsheet using Github:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create an account with Github if you don't already have one.</li>
                <li>Once logged in find and click on the "New Repository" button.</li>
                <li>It will ask for a name, description, and whether to include a "README". Fill out the name, description, and check the Readme box.</li>
                <li>You should now see a screen listing out the files in the repository (it's a very short list) There should also be a big green button labeled "Clone or download" Click on it and copy the URL in the box. (should look something like https://github.com/matkat99/port.git</li>
                <li>At this point you need to decide if you want to manage your repository with the command line or with a GUI tool. (I chose GUI tool)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some helpful things to remember as I reviewed javascript:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remember to double check that your javascript file is properly linked first, when you're not getting the results you expect. (Can't believe how much time I spent on this, haha)</li>
            <li>When appending a child, you should make sure the element you want to attach is the one that goes in the parenthesis.</li>
            <li>Rule of thumb I really need to get better at&mdash;chose words you can spell for variable names. (Label vs lable was killing me today)</li>
            <li>If you're worried something won't work once added to an 'if' statement, don't be afraid to test it out.</li>
            <li>Since for some dumb reason I cannot remember this to save my life, the shortcut for wrapping text in VS is option-z. There. Now I'll remember. (Probably Not)</li>
            <li>Remember the difference between .input and .innerHTML: 
                <ul>
                    <li>.input is for pulling things from the page that users entered in text fields, etc.</li>
                    <li>.innerHTML is for inserting items inside a tag. (Sticking text inside an li tag, for example.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Local storage is accessed with localStorage.getItem(itemgoeshere)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some questions I had now that I've read through the section:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Where exactly are local storage items saved? The server? Is this where a database would come in?</li>
            <li>I'm leaving some sample links in my arrays just so it won't break anything. Hopefully this is okay.</li>
        </ul>
