        <h1>Notes:</h1>
        <p>I'm still having trouble accessing the Novice for Ninja book. Apparently you have to pay for it, but I've heard there's a way to get a discount or just buy that book, so you don't have to pay for the whole thing. I'm not sure how to go about that.</p>
        <p>Anyway, here's my notes from the reading this week:</p>
        <p>I was so excited to read over objects! I remember trying to do something like this before, but I couldn't get it to work. It's nice knowing I'm not crazy and this is a legit Javascript concept. Just some things I noticed that was giving me troubles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It seems I need to start with 'let' not 'var'.</li>
            <li>separate the items in the object with ',' not ';'</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's interesting to me that objects can 'act'. The function that it is acting upon is called a method. You can write them out when you attatch them to the object, or define it first. Examples:</p>
        <p>Function defined while writing the method:</p>
        <p>user.sayHi = function() {<br>
        alert("Hello!");<br>
        };</p>
        <p> or define the function first:</p>
        <p>sayHi () {<br>
            alert("Hello!");<br>
        };<br><br>
        user.sayHi();
        </p>
        <p>For a method to access items inside the oject, you code 'this.(name,age,ect, whatever you want to pull in)' where you need it to pull the oject in. You can also reference it by the object name, instead of this. This method seems more specific. However, if for any reason user was changed, the code could become unreliable. </p>
       

        <h2>Questions from this week:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Can ojects be defined with 'var' instead of 'let'?</li>
            <li>How will methods handle more than one object? Can you have more than one object? (Would it be better to refer to the object name then?</li>
        </ul>
