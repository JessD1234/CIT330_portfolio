        <h1>Notes:</h1>
        <p>I'm having trouble accessing the Novice for Ninja book. Apparently you have to pay for it, but I've heard there's a way to get a discount or just buy that book, so you don't have to pay for the whole thing. I'm not sure how to go about that.</p>
        <p>Anyway, here's my notes from the reading today:</p>
        <p>From javascript hero:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Parameter = a variable put inside the () of a function, which is being passed to the function, and must be defined outside of the function.</li>
            <li>Make sure not to define the variables you're trying to pass to the function within the function. Seems pretty straightforward, but when I have several layers of curley brackets I lose track pretty quickly of where the function ends and begins.</li>
            <li>Novice mistake I keep making: you don't need to put a ':' after return. Probably thinking CSS.</li>
            <li>When wanting to return a variable that was passed to a funciton, don't put '' around it, or it turns it into a string that the function doesn't know what to do with. Same goes for parameters.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> Didn't have too many notes for this week. Most of this was review, which is good. </p>

        <h2>Questions from this week:</h2>
        <p>1. I'm a little confused by the following code:</p>
        <p>function reply(phrase) {<br/>
            return phrase;<br/>
          }<br>
          <br>
          let x = reply('How do you do?');</p>
          <p>This was in a question. It asked me to tell you what x's value was after the function was ran. I answer 'How do you do?', because from my understanding, the function doesn't affect the variable at all, correct? But the question was set up as if it should have. I might just be reading it wrong. For reference, <a href="https://www.jshero.net/en/koans/jsx05.html">this is a link to the question</a>.</p>
          <p><i>Note: I answered my own question later by noticing the variable was calling on the function and inserting 'How do you do?' as the parameter. So basically the variable calls the function, inserts the parameter, and then the function returns the value back to the variable, replacing the call function with the actual text. I think I was overthinking it because it's entirely reduntant, but set up that way on purpose to teach.</i></p>
