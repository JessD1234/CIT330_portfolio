        <h1>Notes:</h1>
       <p>Reading about debugging this week. Here are a few things that stood out to me that I want to remember:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is a strict mode for Javascript! I need to learn more about this and if it'll be useful. One of the hardest part about javascript is the fact that it's so easy to make an error and not know it. It makes it very frustrating to try and use the language. To access strict mode, just add this line to the beginning of a Javascript file: 'use strict';</li>
            <li>You can use alerts in the code as manual break points, since these alerts pause the code and the code won't keep running into the ok button is clicked. It seems this method would give you a more in depth look at your code when combined with debugging in the browser.</li>
            <li>Adding 'debugger' to code works similarly.</li>
            <li>Remember, any in-code debugging tools must be removed before the final product is implemented, or it'll cause issues for the user!</li>
            <li>Functions that return values if the answer is true can be used to test if a function is working right. For example, to test a function that returns the square root, you could run the result of that function through another function that will return true if the result is equal to the correct answer. This allows you to insert a number into your first function, run it, check it against the 'answer key' function, and then see if it ran correctly.</li>
            <li>Test driven coding process:
                <ol>
                    <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>

                       <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
                        
                        <li>Refactor the code</li>
                        
                        <li>Test refactored code</li>
                        
                        <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notes from our group project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When connecting two Javascript files, import and export is needed to get them to communicate.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I didn't have any questions this week.</p>
