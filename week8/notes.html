        <p>The first chapter, I didn't read because I've read it in another class. I'll move my notes in from that class to here.</p>
       <p>The concept of canvas is so cool but it's hard to really grasp it without being able to try it, and I didn't have time to code something like that today. Hopefully we'll be able to experiment with that more later.</p>
       <p>Didn't have much to write about today.</p>
