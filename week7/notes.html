        <h1>Notes:</h1>
       <p>I've been looking ahead and considering what I want to do for my final project. I'm thinking of doing either a calculator program, or a budgetting app. Would either of these be appropriate? I was also thinking of creating a game character sheet that could be updated and stored online, but I'm not sure if I'd be able to figure that one out.</p>
       <p>Anyway, on to my notes for the week.</p>
       <p>Some things I learned about functions:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>They can have properties assigned to them. (how?)</li>
           <li> Adding a .description property actually allows you to assign a description of what the function does, and then it can be called to show us what the description is. Seems useful, instead of having a lengthy description as a comment in the code.</li>
           <li>Things can be stored in a cache.</li>
           <li>Functions can be immediately invoked by wrapping it in parenthesis and adding another set right after. These can be used to store temporary variables.</li>
           <li>Using strict mode within an iiffee function is a convenient way to limit it to just a section of code you want to test, but still run that code like normal without having to call the function it's set in.</li>
       </ul>
        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <p>Is cache the same as local storage? I think of the browser cache when I hear this, and I feel like that's a bit more temporary than local storage, but I could be wrong. </p>
        <p>What's the point of having a function that's temporary? When is this actually used? Is it a good idea to drop un-needed variables?</p>
        <p>I have to be honest, I feel like a lot of this is going over my head at this point. Hopefully I'm understanding.</p>
